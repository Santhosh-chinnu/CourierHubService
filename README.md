Summary: CourierHubService CRUD Operations and Contacts Management
Technologies Used:

Java: Core programming language for backend logic.

Spring Boot: Framework for building the application, providing dependency injection, and simplifying configuration.

Thymeleaf: Server-side Java template engine for rendering HTML views.

JPA (Java Persistence API): ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for managing relational data in the application.

MySQL: Relational database for storing data.

Overview
The CourierHubService is a web application designed to manage courier services and contacts. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing courier services and contact information. The application is built using Spring Boot for backend logic, Thymeleaf for frontend rendering, JPA for database interactions, and MySQL as the database.

Key Features
CRUD Operations for Courier Services:

Create: Add new courier services with details like service name, description, price, etc.

Read: Retrieve and display a list of all courier services or a specific service by ID.

Update: Modify existing courier service details.

Delete: Remove a courier service from the system.

Contacts Management:

Create: Add new contacts (e.g., customers, vendors) with details like name, email, phone, and address.

Read: View a list of all contacts or search for a specific contact by name or ID.

Update: Edit contact details.

Delete: Remove a contact from the system.

User Interface:

Built using Thymeleaf, which integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot to render dynamic HTML pages.

Provides forms for adding/editing courier services and contacts.

Displays lists of courier services and contacts in a tabular format.

Database:

MySQL is used to store data for courier services and contacts.

JPA simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.

Application Workflow:

Frontend (Thymeleaf):

Users interact with the application through HTML forms and pages.

Thymeleaf templates dynamically render data fetched from the backend.

Backend (Spring Boot):

Controllers: Handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and map them to appropriate service methods.

Services: Contain business logic for CRUD operations.

Repositories (JPA): Interface with the database to perform CRUD operations on entities (e.g., CourierService, Contact).

Database (MySQL):

Stores data in relational tables (e.g., courier_services, contacts).

JPA entities represent these tables as Java objects.

Key Components
Entities:

CourierService: Represents a courier service with attributes like id, name, description, price, etc.

Contact: Represents a contact with attributes like id, name, email, phone, address, etc.

Repositories:

CourierServiceRepository: Extends JpaRepository to perform CRUD operations on the CourierService entity.

ContactRepository: Extends JpaRepository to perform CRUD operations on the Contact entity.

Services:

CourierServiceService: Contains methods for managing courier services (e.g., addService, getAllServices, updateService, deleteService).

ContactService: Contains methods for managing contacts (e.g., addContact, getAllContacts, updateContact, deleteContact).

Controllers:

CourierServiceController: Handles requests related to courier services (e.g., displaying the list, adding a new service, updating/deleting a service).

ContactController: Handles requests related to contacts (e.g., displaying the list, adding a new contact, updating/deleting a contact).

Thymeleaf Templates:

shipments.html: Displays a list of courier services and provides options to add, edit, or delete services.

contacts.html: Displays a list of contacts and provides options to add, edit, or delete contacts.

service-form.html: Form for adding/editing a courier service.

contact-form.html: Form for adding/editing a contact.
How It Works:

Adding a Courier Service:

User fills out the form on service-form.html.

Data is sent to the CourierServiceController via a POST request.

The controller calls the CourierServiceService to save the data to the database using CourierServiceRepository.

Viewing Courier Services:

User navigates to services.html.

The controller fetches all services from the database and passes them to the Thymeleaf template for rendering.

Updating/Deleting a Courier Service:

User clicks the edit/delete button on services.html.

The controller handles the request and updates/deletes the service in the database.

Contacts Management:

Similar workflow as courier services, but handled by ContactController, ContactService, and ContactRepository.

Benefits:
Efficient Data Management: CRUD operations simplify data handling for courier services and contacts.

Scalable: Built with Spring Boot, the application is easy to scale and maintain.

User-Friendly Interface: Thymeleaf provides a clean and dynamic user interface.

Database Integration: JPA and MySQL ensure robust and efficient data storage and retrieval.

This application is a practical example of how to build a CRUD-based web application using modern Java technologies. It can be extended further with additional features like user authentication, advanced search, and reporting.
